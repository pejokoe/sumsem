For this submission I compared the performance of tree regressors, random forests and a neural network. Firstly, the best trees/forests/neural net were determined using validation. Evaluation on the test set using rmse accreditted the best performance to the random forest models for all three target variables.
Thus, the results submitted for this week are the predictions of three random forest models.
