For this submission I used decision tree regressors, one for each output variable. The depth of the trees was determined by comparing rmse in train and validation set for each tree for different depths and taking the best performing.
As input, time series composed of the previous, the current and the future value were used. All 50 inputs of an ensemble were processed individually, thus obtaining also 50 outputs. Out of these, I calculated the quantiles.
